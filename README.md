Code Fusion is a collaborative real-time code editor application designed to allow multiple users to work together on the same codebase simultaneously. The core functionality of the project revolves around synchronizing code changes in real-time across all connected users, ensuring that everyone sees the most up-to-date version of the code as it is being edited. The project uses Socket.IO to facilitate real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the clients, allowing for instant updates and collaboration.
